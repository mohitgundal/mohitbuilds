# Quizania - Interactive Web Quiz

---

## Description
This project is an engaging and dynamic web-based quiz application. Designed to be both fun and informative, it allows users to test their general knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. The quiz features a clear user interface, a timer for each question, real-time feedback on answers, and a score-based result screen with dynamic background changes.

* **Countdown Timer:** Each question has a time limit (e.g., 15 seconds) to encourage quick thinking.
* **Live Progress Bar:** A visual indicator shows the time remaining for the current question.
* **Instant Feedback:** Users receive immediate visual feedback (correct/incorrect icons and highlighting) upon selecting an answer.
* **Score Tracking:** Accurately tracks the user's score throughout the quiz.
* **Dynamic Question Loading:** Questions and options are loaded from a separate JavaScript array, making it easy to extend or modify quiz content without touching core logic.
